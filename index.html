      <p class="font_8">URS provides a unique forum for JHU undergraduate students to share their work. Students will have the opportunity to give an 8-10 minute presentation describing their research, followed by 2-3 minutes to field questions from the audience. In previous years, students have used programs such as Powerpoint or Prezi to organize their talks but you have the flexibility to choose whichever presentation style is most suitable for you and your work.</p>
      <p class="font_8" style="display: none">Below you will find tips for a successful symposium-style presentation as outlined by the Society for Neuroscience, as well as a link to their website where you can find other presenter resources.</p>
      <p class="font_8"><span style="font-size:19px; display: none;">Dr. Gorman will lead a How-To Session on <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">October 4th</span></span> from<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5 - 6 pm</span></span>, further clarifying the most effective ways to give a research presentation in a condensed time frame.</span></p>

      <p class="font_8">Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology students are able to meet the Honors criteria outlined by their departments by presenting their research at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.</p>
      <p class="font_8">A new policy requires that at least 9 credits of research be taken before a student may be considered for Honors.</p>
      <p class="font_8"><span style="font-style:italic;"><span class="color_34">I<span style="font-weight:bold;">f you are NOT a Neuroscience or Behavioral Biology student</span></span>, you may still be able to earn Honors credit by participating in URS. To find out if this event qualifies for you, please contact the administrative offices within your department.  Also, make sure that you understand the requirements you must meet to earn Honors</span></p>
      <p class="font_8"><span style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. having faculty members present to assess your involvement in research and ask questions following your presentation to gauge your understanding). We do not coordinate that aspect of URS for you.</span></p></div>

      <p class="font_8">The Undergraduate Research Symposium is a university-wide event open to all students conducting independent projects and participating in research. Reflecting the central philosophy of Johns Hopkins University, URS provides a unique forum for undergraduates to share their intellectual curiosities and passions, and be recognized for their work. This year, we hope to showcase the innovation that can result from collaboration across disciplines and facilitate discussion between students with distinct research focuses. Ultimately, our intent is to showcase the extraordinary and diverse work being done by undergraduate students and to encourage even greater undergraduate participation in research in all disciplines.</p>
      <p class="font_8">​</p>
      <p class="font_8">URS 2018 will be held on Monday, October 8, with student presentations scheduled from 5:00-7:45 pm. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="#keynote" class="smooth">Dr. Gregory Berns</a></span> will then deliver the keynote address at 8:00 pm.</p>
      <p class="font_8">There will be a reception following the keynote speech.</p>

      <p class="font_9"><b>Functional MRI in Awake Unrestrained Dogs</b></p>
      <p class="font_8">The domestic dog’s accessibility, social intelligence, and evolutionary history with humans has led to increasing interest in canine cognition. The demonstration that dogs can be trained to cooperatively participate in fMRI studies – without anesthesia –  has opened up a wealth of new data about canine brain function.</p>
      <p class="font_8">C​anine fMRI experiments can be divided into passive and active tasks. Passive tasks focus on mapping different perceptual systems of the canine brain and include responses to simple and complex visual stimuli (e.g. colored shapes vs. faces), auditory stimuli (sounds, voices), and olfactory stimuli (simple volatiles, biological odors). Passive tasks do not require the dog to do anything except remain motionless. In contrast, active tasks involve the elicitation of a response or a trained behavior. Active tasks present unique challenges because of the potential confound of subject movement. However, when the dog is trained to move only on cue, the movement artifacts can be delayed in time from the salient neural events. Many of these neural measures are found to correlate with out-of-scanner metrics of personality and behavior, and some have been used to predict a dog’s suitability for specific working roles.</p>
      <p class="font_8">Because the dogs participate in many scan sessions over their lifetime, the project has created a unique longitudinal cohort, which, in some cases has allowed the detection of CNS tumors before symptoms appear. These serial awake-MRI have been used to monitor tumor regression following radiation treatment.

          <div id="tip1Description" class="tip">
            Before using any text, image, or other material, make sure that you have the rights to use it. Complex laws and social rules govern how much of someone's work you can reproduce in a presentation. Ignorance is no defense. Check that you are not infringing on copyright or other laws or on the customs of academic discourse when using material.

            Visual Contrast
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            Contrasts in brightness and tone between illustrations and backgrounds improves legibility. The best color combinations include white letters on medium blue, or black on yellow. Never use black letters on a dark background. Many people are red/green color blind - avoid using red and green next to each other.

            Experimental
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            There is no time in a 10-minute paper to teach standard technology. Unless the paper directly examines this technology, only mention what is necessary to develop the theme.

            Graphic Format
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            In graphs, qualitative relationships are emphasized at the expense of precise numerical values, while in tables, the reverse is true. If a qualitative statement, such as "Flow rate increased markedly immediately after stimulation," is the main point of the image, the purpose is better served with a graphic format. A good place for detailed, tabular data is in an image or two held in reserve in case of questions.

            An effective image should have a main point, instead of a collection of available data. If the central theme of the image is not visible, improve the paper by revising or deleting the image.
